# Ask/Tell

  You spend a lot of your life on the shell -- tell it anything you want, and ask to find out what other people are telling.  It's random what you'll get when you ask, though the most recently told messages are weighted much more heavily (in practice, you won't get anything outside of the 10-or-so most recently told things).

    tell "Google Maps is the best."

    ask
    >> True that; double true.
